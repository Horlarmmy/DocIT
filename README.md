# DocIT 

A Decentralized storage platform 
## Project Description
DocIT is a decentralized storage platform that allows users 
to save their files onto which will be minted 
as an NFT. 

Users will also be able to 
view and send the files to
another user from their storage page.

## Technologies Used

* **Solidity** - This was used to write the smart contract of the Dapp
* **NFT.storage** - This serves as a database for storing the users files
* **5ire Chain** - The smart contract was deployed to the 5ire Chain Testnet

## App Details

Contract Address: https://explorer.5ire.network/address/0xbeE78e505F7e36e1dBC37e2BE8C0Ae753478810B

Demo video: 

This is a short description of the architect and structure of our Dapp.

DocIT App is divided into two major parts.

* *Smart Contract* - The smart contract contains the logic behind the storing of Files and minting them as NFTs.
* *IPFS Storage* - This is where the Files are stored and links to them are being generated.

## DocIT Features

The following are the Key Features of  *DocIT*:

* Storage of Files
* Sending and Receiving of Files
* Management of Files 

Data storage: 
Users can store their data on the DocIT network by uploading it through the client-side software. The data is then encrypted and distributed across the network, making it more secure and less vulnerable to data breaches. DocIT uses advanced encryption techniques to ensure that user data is always kept private and secure.

Data retrieval: 
When a user wants to retrieve their data, the client-side software requests the data from the storage network. The network locates the data, decrypts it, and sends it back to the user. Because the data is stored across multiple nodes on the network, it is less likely to be lost or inaccessible.

Data sharing: 
DocIT allows users to share their data with others by providing them with a link to the data stored on the network. The link can be password-protected and set to expire after a certain amount of time, giving the user greater control over who can access their data. DocIT's data sharing functionality is particularly useful for collaborative projects, remote teams, and other situations where data needs to be shared securely and efficiently.

Data backup: 
DocIT provides users with a reliable backup solution that ensures their data is always available, even in the event of a hardware failure or natural disaster. Because the data is stored across multiple nodes on the network, it is less likely to be lost or inaccessible.

## USAGE

Users connect their wallet to the Dapp, and navigates to the upload page and uploads their files, after user have been notified that "File has been uploaded". User can navigate to the documents page to view their uploaded documents, User can also share the document with other users.
